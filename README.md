Challenge Summary
Find value of a specific index of the linked list

Challenge Description
find the value of the last node in the linked list. Based on that value, find the value of the node that is the distance away from the last node based on the value of the last node

Approach & Efficiency
count once, loop through, and then find the value in a second loop once the value of the end of the array was found.

Solution
I think I got it, but I am having a weird linter error that I can't catch. All other comparable code seems to syntaktically correct, but it wont run to test it. Better eyes appreciated.
