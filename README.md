# cc-tictactoe

Challenge Summary
Write a function that can record who wins in tic tac toe. 

Challenge Description
Compare values of 2d arrays, finding out if the win conditions for the common rules of tictactoe are met by either X or O, or if it was a draw.

Approach & Efficiency
Initial whiteboard approach was terrible. After some direction and a ton of research to just apply ideas to the problem, I think I got it pretty close. It is a beast and I am sure there is a better way.

Solution
At this skill level, I decided to go the compare row at column values, and column at row values for possible 3 in a row matches. Pretty sure it works like intended, just looks bulky to me.
